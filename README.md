  - Groom's mom, dad, parents
  - Family groups, guests, children
- Assigns confidence scores to detections
- Categorizes images into person-specific groups
- **Saves**: `person_categorization.json`

### Phase 6: Final Selection & Ranking
- Combines scores:
  - LLM score (70%)
  - Local quality score (20%)
  - Cluster representative bonus (10%)
- Applies intelligent curation for ceremony balance
- Ensures diverse representation across:
  - Key Rituals (35%)
  - Emotional Moments (20%)
  - Pre-Wedding (15%)
  - Details (10%)
  - Portraits (12%)
  - Other (8%)

### Phase 7: Organization & Saving

- Applies quotas for each person category
- Names files with rank prefix (001_, 002_, etc.)
- Generates comprehensive CSV report with all scores
- Creates summary report with pipeline statistics
- **Saves**: Images organized by person + detailed reports
